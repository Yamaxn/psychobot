            <h2>Understanding Depression</h2>
            <p>Understanding depression is an essential aspect of mental health awareness.
                Depression is a mood disorder that causes persistent feelings of sadness,
                hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities. It can affect how you feel,
                think, and handle daily activities, impacting various aspects of life, including
                work, relationships, and physical health. Understanding depression involves
                recognizing its symptoms, such as persistent sadness, fatigue, changes in appetite
                or sleep patterns, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. It's crucial to seek
                help from mental health professionals and support from loved ones to manage
                depression effectively. Treatment options may include therapy, medication,
                lifestyle changes, and support groups.</p>
